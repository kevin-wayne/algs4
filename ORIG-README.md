## Overview

<IMG SRC="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/cover.png"  align=right hspace=25 width=100 alt = "Algorithms 4/e textbook">
This <a href = "https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4">public repository</a>
contains the Java <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/">source code</a>
for the algorithms and clients in the textbook
<a href = "http://amzn.to/13VNJi7">Algorithms, 4th Edition</a> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
This is the official version&mdash;it is actively maintained and updated by the authors.
The programs are organized in the package <code>edu.princeton.cs.algs4</code>.
If you need only the class files (and not the source code), you can use
<a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar">algs4.jar</a> instead.

## Design goals

Our original goal was to cover the <em>50 algorithms that every programmer should know</em>.
We use the word <em>programmer</em> to refer to anyone engaged in trying to accomplish
something with the help of a computer, including scientists, engineers, and applications
developers, not to mention college students in science, engineering, and computer science.
The code is optimized for clarity, portability, and efficiency. While some of our 
implementations are as fast as (or faster than) their counterparts in <tt>java.util</tt>,
our main goal is to express the core algorithmic ideas in an elegant and simple manner.
While we embrace some advanced Java features (such as generics and iterators),
we avoid those that interfere with the exposition (such as inheritance and concurrency).

## Build managers

This repository is intended for use with either the <a href = "https://maven.apache.org">Maven</a>
or <a href = "https://gradle.org">Gradle</a> build managers.
It can be run from either the command line or integrated into
Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ.
You can also access it via <a href = "https://bintray.com/algs4/maven/algs4">Bintray</a>.

## Coursera Algorithms, Part I and II students

## Contribute to this repository

This <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/wishlist.txt">wishlist.txt</a>
contains a list of algorithms and data structures that we would
like to add to the repository. Indeed, several of the algorithms and
data structures in this repository were contributed by others. If interested, please
