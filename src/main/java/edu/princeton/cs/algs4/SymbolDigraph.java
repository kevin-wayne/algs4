/**
 *  The <tt>SymbolDigraph</tt> class represents a digraph, where the
 *  vertex names are arbitrary strings.
 *  By providing mappings between string vertex names and integers,
 *  it serves as a wrapper around the
 *  {@link Digraph} data type, which assumes the vertex names are integers
 *  between 0 and <em>V</em> - 1.
 *  It also supports initializing a symbol digraph from a file.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses an {@link ST} to map from strings to integers,
 *  an array to map from integers to strings, and a {@link Digraph} to store
 *  the underlying graph.
 *  The <em>index</em> and <em>contains</em> operations take time 
 *  proportional to log <em>V</em>, where <em>V</em> is the number of vertices.
 *  The <em>name</em> operation takes constant time.
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation, see <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42digraph">Section 4.2</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
