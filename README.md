# ALGORITHMS

This is a fork of kevin-wayne/algs4, the code from the popular textbook _Algorithms_, 4th Edition, by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick.

## How is this different?

My fork is mostly the same but I am updating the repository using modern Java standards.

The codebase uses SLF4J for logging JUnit 5 to unit test the code I've touched. Unit tests have been added in the idiomatic location (src/test/java).

Data files are provided separately as a zip download on the [online book site](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) but I am copying the ones I'm using into the idiomatic location (src/main/resources).

I have also added some new packages, found under the namespace _com.scottshipp.code_. Included in this, I have been working on the *exercises* given in the [online book site](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/). In some cases, I am also practicing re-implementing fundamental algorithms on paper, then manually copying my paper-written code into the appropriate package where I unit test it. 

I'm doing that to re-learn algorithms and keep sharp.

After all, the tag line for _Algorithms_ is:

```
essential information that
every serious programmer
needs to know about
algorithms and data structures
```
