# ALGORITHMS

This is a fork of kevin-wayne/algs4, the code from the popular textbook _Algorithms_, 4th Edition, by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick.

## How is this different?

My fork is mostly the same but uses modern Java tools and standards.

For example, I have added:

* SLF4J for logging 
* JUnit 5 to unit test the code I've touched
 
Unit tests have also been added in a new location (src/test/java) according to popular standard.

Another difference is that while data files are provided separately as a zip download on the [online book site](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), I have directly included any that I've used into the idiomatic location (src/main/resources).

I have also added some new packages, found under the namespace _com.scottshipp.code_. Included in this, I have been working on providing answers to selected *exercises* from the [online book site](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/). In some cases, I am also practicing re-implementing fundamental algorithms on paper, then manually copying my paper-written code into the appropriate package where I unit test it. 

I'm doing that to re-learn algorithms and keep sharp.

After all, the tag line for _Algorithms_ is:

```
essential information that
every serious programmer
needs to know about
algorithms and data structures
```
